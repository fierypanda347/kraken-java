# Kraken - Student Analytics. Made Smarter.

## What is Kraken?

Kraken is a program to help teachers out with reports on how the class is doing with useful graphs and charts. It allows teachers to enter assessment marks and see how a student has progressed, how the student is doing compared to the class, and many more such visualisations. Kraken also has a few side features such as a database for teachers to enter their students' marks and a few tools that help out with class planning such as dividing the class into groups, sorting students in an alphabetical or roll number wise order.
